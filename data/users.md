# Users

Users in Budibase are global. To add, remove or edit users, have a look at the [User Management page](../admin/user-management.md).

The Users table in Budibase is where you can edit the current application roles. These can then be applied in the User Management page. You can also add columns that are specific to your application here. This data will only be available in this app.

The User table in Budibase is a bit different to other tables that you create. You can't delete or add users or update some of their core information, like first and last names.
